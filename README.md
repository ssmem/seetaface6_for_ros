# seetaface6python

```
add
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:~/seetaFace6Python/seetaface/lib/ubuntu
to your .bashrc  (maybe you should use absolute path)

Attention:
add this 2 lines to keep conda-python away from ros-python:
import sys
sys.path.remove('/opt/ros/kinetic/lib/python2.7/dist-packages')


```
